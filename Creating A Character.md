## Determining Stats:
#### Determining <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Base Stats</span>:
- All 15 Stats are separated into 5 main categories: Strength, Deftness, Intellect, Instinct, and Charm.
- Each category will be determined by rolling 2d4 and using the value to determine the modifier of the stats in the provided category.
- First you will roll 2d4, and use the outcome to add points to each stat in a category. Each point added to a stat increases its modifier by +1. Keep in mind that each stat has a base of -1, and investing a point will set it to +0.
- For one category you may roll 3d4 and keep the two highest. This is to ensure your main stat is mostly positive. 
- Ex.
	- To determine: the Strength category you must roll 2d4, you roll a 6. You then will distribute the points to each stat in the category: Strength, Guts, and Endurance.
	- Default: Strength: -1, Guts: -1, Endurance: -1
	- Distributing the 6 points: Strength: -1 + 3 = +2, Guts: -1 + 2 = +1, Endurance: -1 + 1 = +0
	- Your character would have a +2 in Strength, a +1 in Guts and a +0 in Endurance. 
- Ex. 2
	- To determine: the Strength category you must roll 2d4, you roll a 3. You then will distribute the points to each stat in the category: Strength, Guts, and Endurance.
	- Default: Strength: -1, Guts: -1, Endurance: -1
	- Distributing the 6 points: Strength: -1 + 1 = +0, Guts: -1 + 2 = +1, Endurance: -1 + 0 = -1
	- Your character would have a +0 in Strength, a +1 in Guts and a -1 in Endurance.

## Core Abilities:
- When first creating a character you must pick up to **3 Core Abilities**. These abilities come with the amount of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Action Dice</span> you will have to work with at the start of the game.
- Core Abilities will contain: passive abilities, active abilities, items, and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:rgb(33, 235, 60)">Action Dice</span>.
## Origin
- When first creating a character you must pick an Origin. Origins have mostly passive abilities and add flavor to your character. 
- The Origin chosen will determine was your characters base appearance is and where in the world they are originally from.
- These are similar to Race or Species from other games.
