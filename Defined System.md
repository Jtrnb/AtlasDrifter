- The value of these dice will determine what actions you can take and the strength of those actions. 
- When Action Dice are removed the Action Dice Pool they are no longer usable until they replenished at the start of your next turn, unless otherwise stated.
- On your turn you may spend any number of Action Dice to take actions, unspent dice may be used for Fluid or Defensive actions. 
- Unused dice are not rolled at the start of your turn and instead hold their current value.

- Fluid Actions are actions that may be used off of your turn or in response to other actions. These actions may be used only in response to the triggers given on each Fluid Action, or between actions of another play. Fluid Actions may not interrupt an Active action unless otherwise stated.
#### Blocking (Defensive):
- When getting attacked by a non-AOE ability, you may spend a die or dice based on dice used to deal damage to you. If an opponent used 1d4 to hurt you, spend 1d4 to block. 
#### Dodging (Defensive):
- When getting attacked, you may choose to dodge by spending any Action Die. Doing so prevents you from taking any additional Defensive or Fluid actions during this turn.
- When Dodging, you must roll your Evasion Die and add its modifier. If the value rolled is higher than the damage you were about to take you take no damage and successfully dodge.
