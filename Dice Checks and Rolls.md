#### General Rules
Checks are made through rolling the amount of d12 you have allocated to a certain stat. When rolling, you will keep the 2 highest 2d12 and apply that to the target value.
###### Die Amounts:
- Specialized: 3d12
- Neutral: 2d12
- Weak: 1d12
###### Average Target Values:
- Impossible: 30
- Hard: 20
- Average: 14
- Easy: 10


#### Types of Checks:
###### Stat/ Sub-Stat Checks
- These checks involve the players Stats and Sub-Stat and are often used to gather information or take basic actions. When making this type of check, the player will look at the given Stat/Sub-Stat their are rolling for. They will then add all relevant modifiers and roll the necessary amount of dice.
Ex.
- A player needs to roll for Guts. They have Guts specialization, meaning they will roll 3d12 instead of 2d12. They roll a 22. They will then add their Guts modifier to the roll. They have +2 to Guts rolls. Their total roll would be their 22 + 2 their guts modifier = 24 total.
- A player needs to roll for Deception. They do not have specialization, they will roll only 2d12. They roll a 7. Their Deception modifier is - 3. Their total roll would be 7 - 4 = 3

#### Degrees of Success
When a player makes a check, they will try to roll higher than a events Challenge Level (CL). Their rolls will have various degrees of success based on their roll. These range from:
- Total Success: The player does the desired action without consequence
- Partial Success: The player does the desired action with some level of consequence
- Partial Failure: The player does not complete the action, and something went well
- Total Failure: The player des not complete the action, and there are more consequences
Ex.
The player needs to make a CL 15 check.
- 15-20 would yield a partial success
- 21-24 would yield a total success
- 10-14 would yield a partial failure
- >10 would yield a total failure


#### Strain & Over Extending
When rolling a Stat/ Sub-Stat Check, a player may choose to add an additional 1d6 to their roll, this is called **Over Extending**. Doing so will cause the one of the players Stats/Sub-Stats to become strained. 

- If a player Over Extends and succeeds the check, the player gains 1 strain in the Stat/Sub-stat they rolled for. 

- If the player Over Extends and fails the check, the player gains 2 strain in the Stat/Sub-stat they rolled for. 
Each strain reduces the available dice pool for each roll in the Stat/Sub-Stat by 1d6. 
Ex.
- 2d12 + 1 strain = 1d12 and 1d6
- 2d12 + 2 strain = 1d12

After making a check with a strained Stat/Sub-Stat or after a rest, the player loses the strained condition on that Stat/Sub-Stat. However, if a player Over Extends while strained, the strained die effect still applies, and the strained effects add together. 
	Ex.
- Player rolls 1d12 and 1d6 due to having 1 strain. If they over extend they roll 2d12 again.
	- If that player succeeds the roll, their next roll will by only 1d12, due to them gaining 1 strain.

- If a player loses all of their dice from strain, they will automatically fail checks in the given Sub-Stat until they lose the strained condition.


#### Advantage and Disadvantage
When a player has advantage on a roll they will re-roll one of their d12's and take the higher values. The opposite is true for disadvantage.

If a player has both advantage and disadvantage, they lose both conditions.


#### Doubles
When a player rolls doubles, they lose any strained conditions. The roll is treated as a total success and will yield the best outcome possible. 

*Optional.*
When a player rolls double 1s, the GM may choose to make that a total failure.


#### Branch Tokens
When a player gains a Branch Token, they may choose to expend it to get bonuses on rolls. Expending a Branch Token adds an additional 1d12 to a roll. 


#### Crippling Tokens
When a player fails an Over Extended roll, or a player loses consciousness, the GM will gain Crippling Token. The GM may choose to use these tokens to impose negative effects on rolls. When using a Crippling Token, the chosen roll will have 1d12 subtracted from the roll. A player may not use a branch token to counteract this.
