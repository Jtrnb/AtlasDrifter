**Each Level Gives fixed Hitpoints**
increase base stats every couple levels
Maybe use a skill tree or multiple for different upgrades
Less “Actions” the later you go for simplicity

Every other level you gain an ability, which can contains passives, actives etc.

The levels where you don’t get an ability you can upgrade an ability/ action die

  

Health fixed gain each level

Stat bonuses should come every 3 levels? Could be packaged with abilities or on the off ability during the upgrade

  

Some abilities may have pre-requisites

Maybe make small trees for these, ie familiar and it’s further upgrades

Each level has its own abilities for each focus. 
you pick a main focus which levels up always when you level up. 
after certain levels you get a "level coin" which can be put into any other focus.
these level coins can be a level 1 coin or a level 3 coin etc and correspond to that focuses level ability equal to the coin
