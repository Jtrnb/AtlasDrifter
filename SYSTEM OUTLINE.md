You get one free movement per turn and any other movement uses action points

defensive actions and combative actions 
defense is faster than offense 


Death Born idea: when you die ,depending how you can easily be revived once as a new death born type entity. Deathborn cannot be revived 


**Range:** Weapons will have a minimum range, enemies closer than that range are attacked with a negative 1d6 to the roll. The range value causes 1d6 to be removed from the roll for each increment of this value. 
- Ex. Your bow has a maximum range of 20 feet and a range of 10 feet, at 30 feet you take a 1d6 penalty, at 40 feet you take a 2d6 penalty and so on.

**Armor:** Armor can add a temp hitpoint thingy that when depleted causes the armor to be damaged and must be repaired (can make auto repair at rest etc.)

**Shields**

**Burdens:** Players can add bonus d4 to their rolls by taking burdens, which will do negative things. Burdens can have various effects, lowering AC, Health, Disadvantage. Getting rid of burden should be costly and long term, healer class shouldn't be able to do it. 2 week long rest style

**Actions:** Action points are based on dice rolled that give a value that can be spent on "actions". The dice pool is determined by the class

Fluid actions switch turns so players are incentivized to work together to fully utilize all of their dice. also passing a turn allows unused dice to be used for defence. 

all values are simple and ez so combat isnt slow
