Base action dice are determined by CORE abilities that you choose upon character creation. One CORE ability will be a weapon

Actions require a value, spend any dice to do them

Shield and Armor add Armor and Barrier and Defense, active health bars on them
## Likes:

- Fluid "Proficiency Bonus"
- Mastery/ Familiarity
- Action "points" in combat
- High Rolling Matters
- Different Costs per "action"

- Reward creativity
- Varying Dice for checks (not everything needs to be the d20 all the time)
- Range Matters
- Durability but tasteful
- Less Emphasis on Chance

## Dislikes:
- true pass fail
- Opportunity attacks/ reactions for free
- mindless action that's not automatic 
- Granular Rules
- Damage Variance


You get one free movement per turn and any other movement uses action points

defensive actions and combative actions 
defense is faster than offense 


Death Born idea: when you die ,depending how you can easily be revived once as a new death born type entity. Deathborn cannot be revived 


**Range:** Weapons will have a minimum range, enemies closer than that range are attacked with a negative 1d6 to the roll. The range value causes 1d6 to be removed from the roll for each increment of this value. 
- Ex. Your bow has a maximum range of 20 feet and a range of 10 feet, at 30 feet you take a 1d6 penalty, at 40 feet you take a 2d6 penalty and so on.

**Armor:** Armor can add a temp hitpoint thingy that when depleted causes the armor to be damaged and must be repaired (can make auto repair at rest etc.)

**Shields**

**Burdens:** Players can add bonus d4 to their rolls by taking burdens, which will do negative things. Burdens can have various effects, lowering AC, Health, Disadvantage. Getting rid of burden should be costly and long term, healer class shouldn't be able to do it. 2 week long rest style

**Actions:** Action points are based on dice rolled that give a value that can be spent on "actions". The dice pool is determined by the class

Fluid actions switch turns so players are incentivized to work together to fully utilize all of their dice. also passing a turn allows unused dice to be used for defence. 

all values are simple and ez so combat isnt slow 






**Each Level Gives fixed Hitpoints**
increase base stats every couple levels
Maybe use a skill tree or multiple for different upgrades
Less “Actions” the later you go for simplicity

Every other level you gain an ability, which can contains passives, actives etc.

The levels where you don’t get an ability you can upgrade an ability/ action die

## LEVELING

Health fixed gain each level

Stat bonuses should come every 3 levels? Could be packaged with abilities or on the off ability during the upgrade

  

Some abilities may have pre-requisites

Maybe make small trees for these, ie familiar and it’s further upgrades

Each level has its own abilities for each focus. 
you pick a main focus which levels up always when you level up. 
after certain levels you get a "level coin" which can be put into any other focus.
these level coins can be a level 1 coin or a level 3 coin etc and correspond to that focuses level ability equal to the coin
